To stay adequately hydrated, drink water regularly throughout the day, especially before, during, and after exercise. Pay attention to signs of dehydration, such as thirst, dark urine, or fatigue, and adjust your fluid intake accordingly. Sports drinks containing electrolytes may be beneficial for prolonged or intense exercise sessions, as they help replenish lost electrolytes and maintain hydration levels."
